# https-greenhorn (scaffold)\n\nThis repository contains a minimal scaffold for an anime review site built with Next.js and Prisma. It includes simple affiliate and ad components, a Prisma schema, a Docker compose for local Postgres, and a small seed script.\n\nQuick start (phone-friendly)\n\n1) Create branch and review files (already created: scaffold-next-prisma).\n2) Edit .env.local (copy from .env.example). If you run locally with Docker, leave DATABASE_URL as-is.\n\nRun locally (desktop recommended):\n- Install Node 18+ and Docker\n- Start Postgres: `docker-compose up -d`\n- Install deps: `npm install`\n- Generate Prisma client: `npx prisma generate`\n- Run migrations: `npx prisma migrate dev --name init`\n- Seed: `npx ts-node prisma/seed.ts`\n- Start dev server: `npm run dev`\n\nDeploy (Vercel recommended):\n- Create a managed Postgres (Supabase/Neon/Render) and copy DATABASE_URL\n- In Vercel project settings set the env vars and deploy\n\nAds & affiliate notes\n- Use the AffiliateButton component on anime pages for affiliate links.\n- Use AdSlot for Google AdSense placement. AdSlot shows a placeholder in development and only loads AdSense in production.\n- Add a Privacy Policy page before requesting AdSense approval.\n\nIf you want, I can continue by wiring auth and review APIs, adding a small admin UI, or helping you deploy to Vercel. Reply with what you want me to do next.\n
